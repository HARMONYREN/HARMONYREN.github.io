**HARMONY連** (read "**HARMONY REN**") is an **Open Innovation Collective** founded in Italy, focused on research, discussion, and innovation.

## How does the collective work?
There are three main kinds of members:
- **Debater** - Open to everyone. Can read, write, submit, and review theses.  
Contributes to discussion and development but holds no legal or financial responsibilities.
- **Core Member** - A legally recognized role. Holds the same abilities as a Debater, **plus** the right to earn income and assume legal responsibilities within the collective.
- **Proxy** - A member who represents a legal entity that wants to work with HARMONY連.
