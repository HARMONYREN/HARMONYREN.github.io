# About Us

**HARMONY連** (read "**HARMONY REN**") is an **Open Innovation Collective** founded in **Italy**, focused on **research**, **discussion**, and **innovation**.

## How does the collective work?
There are three main kinds of members:  
**Debater**: Open to everyone. Can read, write, submit, and review theses. Contributes to discussions and development but holds no legal or financial responsibilities.  
**Core Member**: A legally recognized role. Holds the same abilities as a **Debater**, **plus** the right to earn income and assume legal responsibilities within the collective.  
**Proxy**: An individual who represents a legal entity that wants to work with HARMONY連.

To get involved with us, please refer to [Get Involved](/get-involved).


## Purpose of Theses
Theses are documents designed to present ideas in a rational, structured manner. Each thesis should include:

- A clear proposal.
- Its corresponding **antithesis**, outlining potential objections or counterpoints.
- An explanation of **why the proposal matters**.
- A high-level description of how it can be implemented (detailed elaborations can follow in subsequent work).

Each thesis must be **cryptographically signed**, which can be done using [所ID](https://github.com/kai5041/shoid).  
**Note**: The signature must be submitted as a separate binary file.

If the thesis is produced collaboratively:
- List all contributors in the **authors** section along with their IDs.
- Include each contributor’s **cryptographic signature** and key ID when submitting the thesis.
