## Become a Core Member

Anyone interested in becoming an official member of **HARMONY連** can reach out to {{ kai_placeholder }} via [Contact Us](/contact-us).  

If your involvement generates income, a legally binding agreement is required, as all members operate as independent contractors.  
This agreement must be signed with an **eIDAS-compliant electronic signature**.

**NOTE**: For legal reasons, we currently accept legally contracted members residing in Italy only.  
We plan to expand internationally in the future with the support of [所ID](https://github.com/kai5041/shoid).

## Become a Proxy

Looking to partner with **HARMONY連** as an organization?  You can choose one of your workers as a proxy or delegate a member of HARMONY連 to represent your legal entity.  

Proxies hold the same rights and responsibilities as **Core Members**,
allowing your organization to actively participate in our initiatives.
